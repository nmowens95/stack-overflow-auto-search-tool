error_checkor:

Explanation:
    The execute_python_code function takes the user's Python code as input and executes it using the subprocess module.
    The code is executed using the python -c command, and both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams are captured.
    If the return code of the process is non-zero, it indicates an error occurred during execution.
    If an error is detected, the function returns a dictionary with success, error_type, and error_message keys to indicate the error type and message. 
    If no errors are found, it returns a dictionary with success and output keys.
Usage:
    When you run the python_error_checker.py script, it will prompt you to enter Python code. It will then execute the code and display any errors or the output if no errors are found.

stack_overflow_api:

Explanation:
    The search_stack_overflow function takes the error type and error message as input and constructs a URL to make an API request to Stack Overflow's search endpoint.
    It uses the requests library to perform the HTTP GET request and handle potential exceptions.
    The title parameter is used to search for the error type in thread titles, while the q parameter searches for the error message.
    The script prints the titles and links of relevant threads found in the search results.
Usage:
    When you run the stack_overflow_search.py script, it will prompt you to enter the error type and error message obtained from Step 2. It will then make an 
    API request to search for relevant Stack Overflow threads based on these inputs.
